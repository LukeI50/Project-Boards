## Purpose Statement:
What is Boards?
Boards is a project tracker, very similar to the project boards found on GitHub. It is designed to allow individuals, and groups, keep track of projects they might have in a manner that makes progress easilly visual. 
Essentially, this is a web app designed with the Agile methodology in mind. As such it will aid in any work that is already suited, or could be adapted to suit the requirements of Agile.

<summary>Target Audience/Demographic</summary>
Who is this app/project for?

It will cater to many different groups, individuals, and teams, across fields. Though its benefits will primarily be seen by those who have to most need to keep track of their tasks within a team or general life. Demographics likely to benefit at face value are...

- Students:
    - individually they will be able to keep track of their work
    - groups can keep track of a group project meaning that everyone is up to date no matter what
- Coders/Software Engineers:
    - similarly to GitHub, this project tracker will provide a similar functionality to the project boards found on GitHub
    - Agile development teams, that could keep track of a project with multiple editors
- Businesses:
    - businesses that have a strong culture of planning and making tasks visible
    - large teams of people that need to be aware of how a project is coming along

What is the value in Boards?

Boards aims to provide a simple alternative to the project trackers on GitHub. It aims to provide an uncomplicated UI that is easily navigable to users. 

- Simpler to user that GitHub Projects
- Allows users to keep track of their tasks relevant to a specific project
- Allows groups to keep track of work and task completeion
- Aids in the visualisation of a projects progress

Important information regarding your Individual Full-Stack Project
Please read before beginning your portfolio project
At least 1 original custom model, with associated functionality, is required for your Individual Full-Stack Project.

What is an original custom model?
An original custom model is represented as one of the following:

An original model, created by you, for the purposes of your project.
A model used in a previous Django walkthrough project (For example the Codestar blog), that has been changed for the purposes of your project.
What is not an original custom model?
An unaltered model used in a previous Django walkthrough project (For example the Codestar blog) is not considered to be a custom original model.
What is acceptable for your project?
At least one original custom model must be present.
If the models present in a previous Django walkthrough project are used unaltered as a basis for your portfolio project, you should include at least one additional original custom model to either act independently or integrate with the existing models. 
Examples include (but are not limited to) models with associated functionalities for:
the ability to create, edit, and cancel bookings
the ability to create, edit, and delete reviews
the ability to submit testimonials
recording of user contact requests in the database
